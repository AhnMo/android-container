# Build a Lightweight Docker Container For Android Testing

In this sample, we're going to build a lightweight Android container to isolate the testing process.

* No Android Studio/GUI applications required.
* Android emulator runs on a Docker container.
* Has ability to cache dependencies for later build.
* Wipe out everything after the process.

### Motivation
As the team is scaling up, increase CI machine power should be considered as a must! 

By using a Docker container, we can build and run tests for multiple feature branches, speeding up the development and increasing productivity.

It's easy to scale, maintain and stabilize the CI processes.

### Build Steps 

The sample that we're going to use is [Sunflower](https://github.com/android/sunflower).

> Sunflower is a gardening app illustrating Android development best practices with Android Jetpack.

It is built with `gradle-5.4.1`, `Android API 28` and `Build tools v28.0.3`. 

Build docker image with following arguments:

```shell
$ docker build \
--build-arg GRADLE_VERSION=5.4.1 \
--build-arg ANDROID_API_LEVEL=28 \
--build-arg ANDROID_BUILD_TOOLS_LEVEL=28.0.3 \
--build-arg EMULATOR_NAME=test \
-t android-container:sunflower .
```

Clone and go to top level directory of sunflower:

```shell
$ git clone https://github.com/android/sunflower \
&& cd sunflower/
```

Mount the directory into container and run Gradle tasks:

```shell
docker run --privileged -it --rm -v $PWD:/data android-container:sunflower bash -c ". /start.sh && gradlew test && gradlew connectedAndroidTest -p /data"
```

### Result
Let see how it works: 

```shell
> Task :app:connectedDebugAndroidTest

com.google.samples.apps.sunflower.PlantDetailFragmentTest > testShareTextIntent[test(AVD) - 9] SKIPPED

Cool, it just takes 2.872 seconds to run 11 UI tests on my computer!

Please be aware the container will be killed after the process. You can check the status with `docker ps -a`.
